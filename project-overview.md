# Project Overview

Project Name: Mock Apple Watch "Stop Smoking" Visualizer

Description: A web application that *simulates* visualizing health and stress data from an Apple Watch to track progress during a "stop smoking" event. The app mocks data and a "Garmin Body Battery" style display to show improvements over time.

Features:
*   Mock Apple Watch Connection: A simulated connection that lets users choose from preset data scenarios.
*   Mock Health & Stress Data: Mock data streams simulating heart rate, stress levels, sleep quality, etc., pulled from an Apple Watch API (mocked).
*   "Body Battery" Visualization: A mocked visual representation of the user's overall "energy level" (like Garmin Body Battery) that increases as they abstain from smoking.
*   Before & After Slides: Simulated "before" (smoking) and "after" (abstaining) views showing the impact on health metrics.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
